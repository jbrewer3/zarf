# Component Actions

Component Actions provide a number of exec entrypoints for a component to perform additional logic during key stages of a component's lifecycle. These actions will be executed with the context that the Zarf binary is executed with. See [Zarf Package Lifecycle](4-package-command-lifecycle.md) for details on the execution sequence of component actions. You can also try out the component actions example [here](../../examples/component-actions/README.md).

## Action Sets

`component.actions` contain the following (optional) keys known as `action sets`:

- `onCreate` - Runs during `zarf package create`
- `onDeploy` - Runs during `zarf package deploy`
- `onRemove` - Runs during `zarf package remove`

## Action Lists

These `action sets` contain (optional) `action` lists. The `onSuccess` and `onFailure` action lists are conditional and depend on the success or failure of previous actions in the same component as well as steps in the component lifecycle.

- `before` - sequential list of actions that will run before this component is processed for `create`, `deploy`, or `remove`
- `after` - sequential list of actions that will run after this component is successfully processed for `create`, `deploy`, or `remove` 
- `onSuccess` - sequential list of actions that will run after **ALL** `after` actions have successfully completed
- `onFailure` - sequential list of actions that will run after **ANY** error during the above actions or component operations

Below are some examples of `action` lists and their usage:

```yaml
components:
  - name: on-create
    actions:
      # runs during "zarf package create"
      onCreate:
        # runs before the component is created
        before:
          # on Windows, touch is replaced with New-Item
          - cmd: touch test-create-before.txt
            # dir is the directory to run the command in
            dir: ''
            # this environment variable will be set for this action only
            env:
              - 'thing=stuff'
            # the number of times to retry the action if it fails
            maxRetries: 0
            # the maximum amount of times the action can run before it is killed, including retries
            maxTotalSeconds: 30
            # determine if actions output should be printed to the console
            mute: false
            # the name of the variable to set with the output of the action
            setVariable: BLEH
        # runs after the component is deployed
        after:
          - cmd: touch test-create-after.txt

  - name: on-deploy-with-dynamic-variable
    actions:
      # runs during "zarf package deploy"
      onDeploy:
        # runs before the component is deployed
        before:
          # setVariable can be used to set a variable for use in other actions or components
          - cmd: echo "meow"
            setVariable: CAT_SOUND
          # this action will have access to the variable set in the previous action
          - cmd: echo "the cat says ${ZARF_VAR_CAT_SOUND}"

  - name: on-deploy-with-timeout
    description: This component will fail after 1 second
    actions:
      # runs during "zarf package deploy"
      onDeploy:
        # defaults allow you to specify default values for the actions in that acitonSet
        defaults:
          # maxTotalSeconds is the maximum amount of time the action can run before it is killed, including retries
          maxTotalSeconds: 1
          # maxRetries is the maximum number of times the action will be retried on failure
          maxRetries: 3
        before:
          # this action will fail after 1 second
          - cmd: sleep 30
        onFailure:
          - cmd: echo "ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ this action failed because it took too long to run ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­"
```

## Action Set Defaults

In addition to the `action` lists above, an `action set` also contains a `defaults` section that will be applied to all actions in the set. The `defaults` section contains all of the same elements as an [action configuration](#action-configuration), except for `cmd` which is not allowed in the `defaults` section. Example:

```yaml
actions:
  onCreate:
    defaults:
      # Set the default directory for all actions in this action set (onCreate)
      dir: dir-1
    before:
      # dir-1 will be used for these action
      - cmd: echo "before"
      # dir-2 will be used for this action
      - cmd: echo "before"
        dir: dir-2
    after:
      # dir-1 will be used for these actions
      - cmd: echo "after"
  onDeploy:
    before:
      # this action will use the current working directory
      - cmd: echo "before"
```

## Action Configuration

Within each of the `action` lists (`before`, `after`, `onSuccess`, and `onFailure`), the following action configurations are available:

- `cmd` - (required) the command to run
- `dir` - the directory to run the command in, defaults to the current working directory
- `mute` - whether to mute the realtime output of the command, output is always shown at the end on failure (default: `false`)
- `maxTotalSeconds` - the maximum total time to allow the command to run (default: `0` - no limit)
- `maxRetries` - the maximum number of times to retry the command if it fails (default: `0` - no retries)
- `env` - an array of environment variables to set for the command in the form of `name=value`
- `setVariable` - set the standard output of the command to a variable that can be used in other actions or components

## Creating dynamic variables from actions

You can use the `setVariable` action configuration to set a variable that can be used in other actions or components. The variable will be set in the environment variable `ZARF_VAR_{NAME}` and `TF_VAR_{name}` in the remaining actions as well as available for templating in files or manifests in the remaining components as `###ZARF_VAR_{NAME}###`. This feature allows package authors to define dynamic runtime variables for consumption by other components or actions. *Unlike normal variables, these do not need to be defined at the top of the `zarf.yaml` and can be used during `package create`, `package deploy` or `package remove`.*

## More examples

### `onCreate`

`onCreate` runs during `zarf package create` and allows a package creator to run commands during package creation. For example if you have a large data file that you need to include in your package you could include something like the following (replacing the url as needed):

```yaml
components:
  - name: on-create-example
    actions:
      onCreate:
        before:
          - cmd: 'wget https://download.kiwix.org/zim/wikipedia_en_100.zim'
```

### `onDeploy.before`

`onDeploy` runs during `zarf package deploy` and allow a package to execute commands during component deployment.

You can use `onDeploy.before` to execute a command _before_ the component is deployed. This example uses the `eksctl` binary to create an EKS cluster. The `eks.yaml` file is included in the package and contains the configuration for the cluster:

```yaml
components:
  - name: before-example
    actions:
      onDeploy:
        before:
          - cmd:"./eksctl create cluster -f eks.yaml"
```

### `onDeploy.after`

You can also use `onDeploy.after` to execute a command _after_ the component is deployed. For example if you need to cleanup resources that were temporarily created during deployment:

```yaml
components:
  - name: prepare-example
    actions:
      onDeploy:
        after:
          - cmd: 'rm my-temp-file.txt'
```

### `onRemove`

`onRemove` runs during `zarf package remove` and allows a package to execute commands during component removal.

:::note

Any binaries you execute in your actions must exist on the machine they are executed on.
